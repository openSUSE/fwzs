Desperately needed:

- watch NetworkManager for connection changes and switch to ext
  automatically
- use PolicyKit instead of dbus at_console
- error handling
- i18n

Optional:
- terminate service after some time
- properly survive dbus restarts
- allow to temporarily enable services (from
  /etc/sysconfig/SuSEfirewall2.d/services, not individual ports!).
- port to C instead of python

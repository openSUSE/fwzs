Firewall Zone Switcher consist of a DBus service and a system
tray applet that lets the user switch firewall zones of network
interfaces.

So you got that shiny new Netbook, installed Linux on it and carry
it along everywhere you go. The default enabled Firewall blocks
incoming traffic so you feel safe when connecting to that anonymous
WiFi network at your favorite fastfood restaurant. Unfortunately the
very same Firewall becomes quite annoying at home where it prevents
your system from discovering printers or blocks ssh. So you have the
choice of either opening the ports permanently or having to use sudo
to enable or disable the Firewall. Well, not anymore with Firewall
Zone Switcher! With that little applet you can now switch the zone
of your network interface to 'internal' with only two mouse clicks
when you are at home. In an untrusted Network you just set the zone
to 'external'. And if you need some custom configuration you could
set the zone 'dmz' to have some open some ports or create a custom
zone.

Firewall Zone Switcher is *not* meant to be some kind of 'Personal
Firewall' that confuses the user with all kinds of low level stuff.
It's neither a Firewall configuration tool. That job is still left
to Admin tools like YaST. Firewall Zone Switcher settings are
temporary and are reset to the system defaults on reboot.
